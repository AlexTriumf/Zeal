# Data Deletion Instructions

To request deletion of your data:
1. Email us at **support@yourdomain.com** from the email/phone number associated with your account.  
2. In the email, state your username or phone number and that you want your account and personal data deleted.  
3. We will verify the request and confirm deletion within 5 business days.

If you implement automation, Facebook expects your deletion callback endpoint to return JSON like:

```json
{
  "url": "https://yourdomain.com/deletion-status/abcdef",
  "confirmation_code": "unique-code-123456"
}
